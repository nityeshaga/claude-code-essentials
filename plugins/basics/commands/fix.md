Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps: 

1. Understand the issue described in the ticket and its comments
2. Locate the relevant code in our codebase 
3. Think ultra hard to come up with a plan that addresses the issue. You can create a temporary markdown file to store a long plan.
4. Share that plan with me and ask me for feedback. Wait for my feedback.
5. Based on feedback, think ultrahard to make atomic TODOS
6. Then start working on those TODOs one by one
7. If the task is a big one, add "checkpoint TODOS" that will act as checkpoints 
to see if the task is on the right track. This is where you ask me to open localhost and verify the progress. If everything is on track we make a commit.
