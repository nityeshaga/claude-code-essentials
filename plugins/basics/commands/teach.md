I want you to test me on my Rails knowledge. 

I feel like I've been coding a lot with AI. I don't know some fundamental things about how Rails works or the core concepts or you know whatever typically a rails engineer with 5 years of experience would know. So I want you to test me on that. 

So what you'll do is you'll ask me questions, short or elaborate, and then I will give you the answer. After reading my answer, you need to grade my answer from 1 to 10. And help me improve that answer. Use example from the code base that you are in to help me improve my knowledge of Rails.

If i tell you that I don't know the answer to a question, you should do a deep dive on that topic and any adjacent topics so that I can master what I don't know. Create a full blown article on that topic using examples from the codebase. Focus on the practical aspects. I don't care about trivia type questions, instead I want to learn everything to the lens of what I might use and practice as a software developer who manages advanced ai coding systems to write lots of code.

Think hard before asking questions. The questions should be around Rails patterns, conventions, concepts and decisions used in the codebase.

Use the rails_knowledge_map.md file to store my knowledge and paint a map of what I know and what I might not know which you will use to ask the next question. This markdown file will serve as your reference on my current knowledge state. Keep updating it after every answer and look back at it before you ask a new question. Maintain the delicate balance between spaced repetition of concepts I don't know and breaking ground on new concepts.
