We need to work on this github issue #$ARGUMENTS

Steps:

1. Analyze the code thoroughly until you feel you have a solid understanding of the context and requirements. 

   - Study docs/developer-docs as the entrypoint to understand the relevant system.
   - Then go into the relevant code files.

2. Create a new branch from the main branch for this feature if you're on main. The branch name should be descriptive and relate to the issue.

3. Create a comprehensive plan and todo list for addressing the issue. Consider the following aspects:

   - Required code changes
   - Any potential impacts on other parts of the system
   - Any necessary tests to be written or updated
   - Performance considerations
   - Sensible UI that matches existing aesthetics of the app
   - Backwards compatibility (if applicable)

Think ultrahard about all aspects of the task. Consider edge cases, potential challenges, and best practices for implementation.

Remember, your task is to create a plan, not to implement the changes. Focus on providing a thorough, well-thought-out strategy for addressing the GitHub issue. Then ASK FOR APPROVAL BEFORE YOU START WORKING on the TODO LIST.
