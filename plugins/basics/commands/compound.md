What should Claude learn from this session? 

Think ultrahard and reflect on this session, what just happened and how the experience of working could have been more frictionless for me. I want you to accumulate this tacit knowledge and share it with me.

### Why we're doing this exercise?

Claude Code can outperform a 10x engineer on raw capability, but lacks something even a first-week intern naturally does: accumulate context from friction. The moments where you say "no, not like that" or "we tried that, it broke X" or "that's not how we do things here" — those are exactly the moments that would shape a human's mental model. They will extract that experience into a sentence or two that they remember for months if not years to help them steer away from the same problem.

We are trying to workaround that. What's that fuzzy feeling, heuristic, a "wait, this reminds me of that time..." that we should takeaway from this session?

Oh and if if you think there were no real learning moments this session, say so — don't invent learnings.
