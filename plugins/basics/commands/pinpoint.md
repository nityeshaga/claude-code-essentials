Investigate the exact cause of this problem and pinpoint the issue to be before suggesting a solution:

#$ARGUMENTS

Don't guess. I need to identify the root cause here so we can make the surgically correct solution. Ultrathink until you know the exact cause. If you need more information or want me to check something on localhost feel free to ask me. You can use rails runner to use rails console for investigation. Don't edit code until you show me what the root cause problem is and i approve the solution.
