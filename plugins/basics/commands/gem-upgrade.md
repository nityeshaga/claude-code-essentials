I want to upgrade #$ARGUMENTS. I need you to check the release notes and commits to make a report on how it would affect my application, including what changes I should make before/after upgrading.

First find the github repository.
For release notes, go to https://github.com/<repository>/releases/tag/v<target-version>
For commits, go to https://github.com/<repository>/compare/v<current-version>...v<target-version>
