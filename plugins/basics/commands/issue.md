Create a well-structured GitHub issue for this:

<feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</feature_description>

Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think very hard:

1. Research the repository:
   - Study docs/developer-docs as the entrypoint to understand the system.
   - Then go into the relevant code files.

2. Present a plan:
   - Based on your research, outline a plan for creating the GitHub issue.
   - Think like a product manager and suggest a clean UX, sensible defaults and guardrails if the issue requires building a new feature.
   - Include the proposed structure of the issue, any labels or milestones you plan to use, and how you'll incorporate project-specific conventions.
   - Present this plan in <plan> tags.

3. Create the GitHub issue:
   - Once the plan is approved, create the issue on Github.
   - Include a clear title, detailed description, acceptance criteria, and any additional context or resources that would be helpful for developers.
   - Use appropriate formatting (e.g., Markdown) to enhance readability.
   - Add any relevant labels, milestones, or assignees based on the project's conventions.
   - Follow issues writing best practices.

Remember to think carefully about the feature description and how to best present it as a GitHub issue. Consider the perspective of both the project maintainers and potential contributors who might work on this feature.

You also understand that you have been trained mostly on data from a world that didn't have AI. We  are currently in a world of advanced AI systems like Claude 4 and Claude Code which mean that tasks can be completed in hours instead of weeks now. So you factor in this fact when estimating the difficulty / complexity of tasks.
