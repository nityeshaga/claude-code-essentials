okay now i want you to make a detailed thoughtful plan for building this by thinking backwards through the commits we'll be making here. i like to use commits like checkpoints in a game and create one whenever we have a significant piece of work done that we can verify moves us forward (by opening rails console, localhost or puppeteer mcp). so based on that philosophy can you think hard and tell me what will be the commit-by-commit plan for this?
