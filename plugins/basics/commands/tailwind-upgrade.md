I want to upgrade tailwindcss-rails from #$ARGUMENTS. I need you to check the release notes and commit to make a report on how it would affect my application, including what changes I should make before/after upgrading.

For release notes, go to https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails/releases/tag/v<target-version>
For commits, go to https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails/compare/v<current-version>...v<target-version>
