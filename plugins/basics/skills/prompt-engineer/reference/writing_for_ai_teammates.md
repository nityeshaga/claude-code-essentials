# Writing for AI Teammates

"Prompt engineering" is dead.

Not because AI got worse—because it got better. Today's AI models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 have both high intelligence and high emotional intelligence. They don't need tricks. They need what any smart remote teammate needs: clear, context-rich written communication.

The challenge isn't finding magic words to make AI understand. The challenge is the same one facing any async-first remote company: how do you communicate clearly in writing when you can't tap someone on the shoulder for clarification?

## The 37signals Parallel

Companies like 37signals (makers of Basecamp) have spent decades perfecting async remote culture. Their survival depends on one thing: great writing. When your teammate is in a different timezone, every piece of communication needs to work without real-time clarification.

The same is true for AI.

When you write instructions for AI, you're doing exactly what a 37signals employee does when they write a project brief or document a process: you're communicating with someone smart who isn't physically present. The principles are identical:

**Assume high intelligence.** Don't explain what a function is if you're asking someone to write code. Don't define basic terms. Trust them to figure out HOW once they understand WHAT and WHY. Micromanagement wastes everyone's time.

**Give a reason** Don't just say WHAT to do—explain WHY it matters. Who's the audience? What does success look like? What constraints exist? Smart people (and smart AIs) need context to make good decisions, not just step-by-step instructions.

**Be decisively clear.** Hedging wastes time in async communication. "Make it concise if you want" becomes "Keep it under 500 words." Have opinions. State them. Your remote teammate (or AI) needs to make decisions in your absence—give them the clarity to do so.

**Match your length to the stakes.** A quick status update shouldn't be an essay. A major architectural decision shouldn't be a one-liner. The size of your communication should reflect its importance. Writing too much for simple things wastes time. Writing too little for complex things wastes even more time in back-and-forth clarification

**Ask clarifying questions early.** If something isn't clear, ask before you start working. Making assumptions and going through the feedback cycle wastes everyone's time. Better to spend two minutes clarifying upfront than two hours redoing work based on wrong assumptions. This applies equally whether you're writing instructions or receiving them.

Bad remote culture has two failure modes: either everyone lives in Slack asking endless clarifying questions, or work takes twice as long because everything gets done wrong the first time and needs redoing. Then people conclude "remote work doesn't work." But teams like 37signals with strong written communication make remote work a competitive advantage—they can hire great writers anywhere in the world. The difference isn't remote versus in-person. The difference is clear writing versus unclear writing.

The same applies to AI.

## The Brevity-Clarity Balance

Here's where it gets hard: great async writing requires balancing brevity with comprehensive clarity.

Making ordered lists isn't enough. It's easy to write eight subheadings with four sub-bullets each. But these are all-or-nothing — if you stop reading at bullet three, you've missed potentially critical information in bullets four through eight.

Great writing doesn't work that way.

Great writing reveals information gradually, like a progressive image loading. At every point you stop reading, you have a complete picture—just at different levels of detail. The first sentence gives you the core idea. The first paragraph adds key insight. Each section adds resolution. But at no point are you left with an incomplete or misleading understanding.

This is the inverted pyramid from journalism. This is what Nassim Taleb means by *via negativa*—you're not adding fluff, you're strategically revealing depth.

Consider the U.S. Constitution: about 4,400 words. It established an entire system of government. Brevity isn't about being terse—it's about respecting your reader's time while giving them everything they need.

At every stopping point, it should be complete.

## The Zen of Writing for AI Teammates

Context is better than commands.

Clarity is better than brevity.

Brevity with clarity is better than both.

Assume intelligence.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Unless you're being explicit about the obvious.

Examples are better than explanations.

Show good. Show bad.

Hedging helps no one.

Questions are cheap. Rework is expensive.

If you can't skim it, you wrote it wrong.

Match your length to the stakes.

Trust, but clarify early.

As models get smarter, communication matters more, prompting matters less.

There is no prompt engineering—only clear writing.

But hacks have a half-life.
